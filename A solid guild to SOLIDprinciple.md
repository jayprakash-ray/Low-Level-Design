# SOLID Principle

1) S - Single Resposibility
    - A class should only concern with single things i.e you should not describe it like it does/represent this and this
2) O - Open Closed Principle
    - A class should be open for extension and closed for modification
    - To enhance the functionality , we should not modify the exisiting methods and variable in the class instead we should be able to extend it and add functionality
